About Me
Hello there! I'm Rajaa EL HAMDANI, a passionate researcher.

🎓 Academic Journey
I moved to Paris in 2013 to study at Centrale Paris, and I'm currently working toward my Ph.D. My research focuses on the exciting intersections of natural language processing and graph machine learning. My journey into academia isn't just a career; it's a lifelong quest to understand the complex relationships between data, language, and human behavior.

🧘‍♀️ Beyond the Screen
When I'm not knee-deep in code or research papers, you'll find me on a Yoga mat or catching some waves. I find that Yoga and surfing are not just hobbies but also forms of moving meditation that help me stay balanced. I'm also an avid proponent of mindfulness practices, and I believe that mental well-being is a journey that everyone should embark on.
