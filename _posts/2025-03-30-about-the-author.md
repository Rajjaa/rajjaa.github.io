# About Me

Hello there! I'm Rajaa EL HAMDANI, a passionate AI researcher dedicated to leveraging language models for effective knowledge extraction.

## 🎓 Academic and Professional Journey

I moved from Casablanca to Paris in 2013 to study at Centrale Paris, and I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. at Télécom Paris, Institut Polytechnique de Paris. My research focuses on utilizing Language Models for Knowledge Extraction: From Non-Parametric Memory to Parametric Memory.

My experience includes developing NLP algorithms to analyze complex legal texts, building AI strategies for startups, and contributing to cutting-edge research in the field. I have also worked as an AI Research Scientist at HEC Paris and as Lead of AI Scientist at Justice.cool. My journey into AI research isn't just a career; it's a lifelong quest to understand the complex relationships between data, language, and human behavior.

## 👩‍💻 Skills and Expertise

I am proficient in a range of machine learning and deep learning techniques, including LLMs, and tools such as Python, Hugging Face.

## 🧘‍♀️ Beyond the Screen

When I'm not knee-deep in code or research papers, you'll find me on a Yoga mat or catching some waves. I find that Yoga and surfing are not just hobbies but also forms of moving meditation that help me stay balanced. I'm also an avid proponent of mindfulness practices, and I believe that mental well-being is a journey that everyone should embark on [cite: 2023-09-27-about-the-author.md]. I also enjoy reading, meditation, running, dancing, video games, and photography.

## 🌐 Languages

I am fluent in French (Bilingual), English (Professional), and Arabic (Native).
