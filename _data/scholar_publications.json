        "abstract": "Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD), a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1 with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0% with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly share the code and dataset at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the factuality of large language models (LLMs) as knowledge bases in the legal domain, in a realistic usage scenario: we allow for acceptable variations in the answer, and let the model abstain from answering when uncertain. First, we design a dataset of diverse factual questions about case law and legislation. We then use the dataset to evaluate several LLMs under different evaluation methods, including exact, alias, and fuzzy matching. Our results show that the performance improves significantly under the alias and fuzzy matching methods. Further, we explore the impact of abstaining and in-context examples, finding that both strategies enhance precision. Finally, we demonstrate that additional pre-training on legal documents, as seen with SaulLM, further improves factual precision from 63% to 81%.",

        "abstract": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data controllers to implement end-to-end compliance. Controllers must therefore ensure that the terms agreed with the data subject and their own obligations under GDPR are respected in the data flows from data subject to controllers, processors and sub processors (i.e. data supply chain). This paper seeks to contribute to bridge both ends of compliance checking through a two-pronged study. First, we conceptualize a framework to implement a document-centric approach to compliance checking in the data supply chain. Second, we develop specific methods to automate compliance checking of privacy policies. We test a two-modules system, where the first module relies on NLP to extract data practices from privacy policies. The second module encodes GDPR rules to check the presence of mandatory information. The results show that the text-to-text …",

        "abstract": "Language models have proven to be very useful when adapted to specific domains. Nonetheless, little research has been done on the adaptation of domain-specific BERT models in the French language. In this paper, we focus on creating a language model adapted to French legal text with the goal of helping law professionals. We conclude that some specific tasks do not benefit from generic language models pre-trained on large amounts of data. We explore the use of smaller architectures in domain-specific sub-languages and their benefits for French legal text. We prove that domain-specific pre-trained models can perform better than their equivalent generalised ones in the legal domain. Finally, we release JuriBERT, a new set of BERT models adapted to the French legal domain.",

Mechanisms for utilizing linguistic resources outside of their original context have significant potential benefits in AI & Law because differences between legal systems, languages, or traditions often block wider adoption of research outcomes. We analyze the use of Language-Agnostic Sentence Representations in sequence labeling models using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) that are transferable across languages. To investigate transfer between different contexts we developed an annotation scheme for functional segmentation of adjudicatory decisions. We found that models generalize beyond the contexts on which they were trained (e.g., a model trained on …",

In this article, we explore how computational indicators are produced to assess lawyers' performance in courtroom litigation, analyzing the specific types of information they can generate. We capitalize on artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze a sample of 8,045 cases from the French Courts of Appeal, explore different associations involving lawyers, courts, and cases, and assess the strengths and flaws of the resulting metrics to evaluate the performance of legal professionals. The methods we use include natural language processing, machine learning, graph mining, and advanced visualization.

We extract legal indicators from judicial judgment to decrease the asymmetry of information of the legal system and the access-to-justice gap. We use NLP methods to extract interesting entities/data from judgments to construct networks of lawyers and judgments. We propose metrics to rank lawyers based on their experience, wins/loss ratio and their importance in the network of lawyers. We also perform community detection in the network of judgments and propose metrics to represent the difficulty of cases capitalising on communities features.",

        "abstract": "Most prominent research today addresses compliance with data protection laws through consumer-centric and public-regulatory approaches. We shift this perspective with the Privatech project to focus on corporations and law firms as agents of compliance. To comply with data protection laws, data processors must implement accountability measures to assess and document compliance in relation to both privacy documents and privacy practices. In this paper, we survey, on the one hand, current research on GDPR automation, and on the other hand, the operational challenges corporations face to comply with GDPR, and that may benefit from new forms of automation. We attempt to bridge the gap. We provide a roadmap for compliance assessment and generation by identifying compliance issues, breaking them down into tasks that can be addressed through machine learning and automation, and providing notes about related developments in the Privatech project.",
